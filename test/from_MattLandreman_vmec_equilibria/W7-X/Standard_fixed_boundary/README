This input file was generated by running 'wout_boundary_to_input' to extract the boundary from a
free-boundary W7-X configuration, and using the result to make a fixed-boundary vmec configuration.

The free-boundary wout file upon which this fixed-boundary case is based was
dowloaded from Geiger's W7-X VMEC database on 2018-07-05:
